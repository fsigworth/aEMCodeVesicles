This is the Git repository for RSC code.
RSC stands for random spherically-constrained single-particle reconstruction.
It is a method for obtaining 3D structures of membrane proteins by electron
cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM).  The image-processing code in this repository runs
under Matlab and does various steps in the processing of micrographs and 3D
reconstruction of the single protein "particles".

Please see README-VesicleFitting.docx for an introduction to the programs and workflow. See Cluster/Running_the_k3Pipeline.rtf for an introduction to running the programs in parallel on a cluster.

Please copy the script startup.m to your home directory. It sets the paths on startup of Matlab.
